     <h2 >CALCULUS</h2>
      <p>
        Calculus is concerned with two basic operations, differentiation and integration, and is a tool used by engineers to determine such quantities as rates of change and areas; in fact, calculus is the mathematical 'backbone' for dealing with problems where variables change with time or some other reference variable</p>

     <h2 >MATHS</h2>
      <p >
        Mathematics is the science and study of quality, structure, space, and change. Mathematicians seek out patterns, formulate new conjectures, and establish truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and definitions.</p>

      <h2>HCI</h2>
      <p> Human-computer interaction (HCI) is a multidisciplinary field of study focusing on the design of computer technology and, in particular, the interaction between humans (the users) and computers. While initially concerned with computers, HCI has since expanded to cover almost all forms of information technology design. </p>

       <h2 >PHYTHON</h2>
        <p >
          Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level dynamic data types, and classes. It supports multiple programming paradigms beyond object-oriented programming, such as procedural and functional programming.</p>
